## The Dactyl-ManuForm keyboard: Opposable Thumb Edition

This, the DMOTE application, is a CAD program for designing a keyboard that
suits you. By editing text files of parameters, you can change:

- Switch type: ALPS, Kailh (PG1511) or MX.
- Microcontroller type: Lots of options.
- Size and shape.
    - Row and column curvature and tilt (tenting).
    - Exceptions at any level, down to the position of individual keys.
- Minor features like LED strips and wrist rests.

Here’s an example of what you can do: A split-hand, concave, columnar,
ergonomic keyboard with large thumb clusters and wrist rests.

### Links

This project, the DMOTE application, is a fork of Tom Short’s
[Dactyl-ManuForm](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard). It’s one of many
forks in the [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) genus.

There’s a small family of accessory projects:

* [`dmote-keycap`](https://github.com/veikman/dmote-keycap):
  A library used directly by the DMOTE application to model both featureless
  maquettes for use in easily rendered previews, and “minimal” keycaps you can
  print and use to save space.
* [`dmote-topography`](https://github.com/veikman/dmote-topography):
  Smooth organic topography for height maps you can use as wrist rests,
  including the example bundled in the [resource folder](resources/heightmap)
  of this project.
* [`dmote-drawer`](https://github.com/veikman/dmote-drawer):
  Assortment drawers for the Concertina, a bundled keyboard design.
* [`dmote-beam`](https://github.com/veikman/dmote-beam):
  Configurable clips for stabilizing a split keyboard by holding a
  connecting rod between the two halves.

Like its parent, the DMOTE project is based on Matthew Farrell’s
[`scad-clj`](https://github.com/farrellm/scad-clj). A second small family of
general CAD libraries for `scad-clj` have grown up around the DMOTE project.

* [`scad-app`](https://github.com/veikman/scad-app): A simple way to turn
  `scad-clj` specifications into applications, stripping out some boilerplate.
  See also [`cad-template`](https://github.com/veikman/cad-template), which is
  all boilerplate for starting new CAD projects that are ready to render.
* [`scad-tarmi`](https://github.com/veikman/scad-tarmi): Commonplace abstractions.
* [`scad-klupe`](https://github.com/veikman/scad-klupe): Threaded fasteners.
