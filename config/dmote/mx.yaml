# Configuration fragment for MX-style switches only.
#
# This illustrates the need to override the default style as well as those
# non-default styles that are defined in dmote/tight_keys.yaml, if youâ€™re using
# that file.
#
# Skirt lengths are added to prevent collisions. This is needed because
# MX-style switches have a deeper base than ALPS-style switches, bringing the
# outer edges of long skirts into contact.
