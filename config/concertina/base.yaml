# A work in progress. Prototyping stage.
#
# This resembles the DMOTE but the hands are vertically oriented, and for this
# reason, the keyboard is joined by a central housing rather than fully split.
# The interface between the central housing and the key clusters is designed to
# make wiring easier than it is on the DMOTE.
#
# This version uses only printable dmote-keycap caps and ALPS-style switches.
# The keys are arranged so tightly in places that other types of caps and
# switches should be expected to require adjustment of the keyboard design.
