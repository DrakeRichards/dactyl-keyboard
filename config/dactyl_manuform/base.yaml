# A configuration fragment for Tom Short’s Dactyl-ManuForm, ca. v0.4.

# The long-term goal with this file is to have it produce Short’s design
# through the DMOTE application for upstream compatibility.
# Similarity is checked by placing Short’s “right-4x5.stl” file
# in the things/scad/ folder and then injecting it into a DMOTE output:
#
# $ echo '%import("right-4x5.stl");' >> things/scad/right-hand-case-main.scad
#
# In that Linux-style shell command, $ represents your prompt.
#
# As of DMOTE v0.6.0, the application is still missing the wire hook
# feature on the original Dactyl-ManuForm, though it could be imitated
# with the tweaks feature. A vertex-perfect imitation would be laborious
# in any case.
