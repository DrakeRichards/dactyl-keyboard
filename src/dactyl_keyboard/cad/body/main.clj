;;; It was once the only body, and only output.
;;; It is currently distinguished by its ability to include a rear housing, and
;;; other features not yet made general.

;;; The long-term plan is for it to have no distinguishing characteristics, at
;;; which point it will exist only as a parameter default, or disappear.
