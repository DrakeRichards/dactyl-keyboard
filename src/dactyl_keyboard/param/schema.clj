    In local nomenclature, the “tweaks” parameter is a grove of trees. Each
    non-leaf node beneath the name level of the grove is a tree that can have
    some extra properties. Lower-level non-leaf nodes are just branches and
    cannot have these extra properties.

    The grove is parsed using a pair of dispatchers, each with its own branch
    parser. The top-level dispatcher replaces itself with the lower-level
    dispatcher each time it passes a non-leaf node, and the lower-level
    dispatcher sustains itself by the trick of its parser being a function that
    refers to itself and thereby passes itself along by recreating the
    lower-lever dispatcher on each pass.

    A candidate to the dispatcher can be a lazy sequence describing a single
    point (a leaf), a lazy sequence of such sequences, or a map. If it is a
    map, it may contain a similar nested structure, or a predigested leaf.

    The leaf parser is permissive, having multiple arities where any positional
    argument can be replaced by a map.  The base case is one anchor, typically
    a key alias, with ordinary specifiers for a side and vertical segment off
    that anchor. However, the parser also accepts a second segment ID to form a
    sweep across a range of segments, and in place of any or all positional
    arguments after the first (typically coming in last), the parser takes a
    map of extras that may overlap the meaning of the positional arguments."
