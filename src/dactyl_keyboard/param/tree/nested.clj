  "A flat version of a special part of a user configuration."
  [["# Nestable configuration options\n\n"
    "This document describes all those settings which can be made at any "
    "level of specificity, from the entire keyboard down to an individual "
    "key. These settings all go under `by-key` in a YAML file.\n"
    "\n"
    "## Conceptual overview\n"
    "\n"
    "Specificity is accomplished by nesting. The following "
    "levels of specificity are currently available. Each one branches out, "
    "containing the next:\n"
    "\n"
    "- The global level, directly under `by-key` (cf. the "
    "[main document](options-main.md)).\n"
    "- The key cluster level, at `by-key` → `clusters` → your cluster.\n"
    "- The column level, nested still further under your cluster → "
    "`columns` → column index.\n"
    "- The row level, nested at the bottom, under column index → `rows` → "
    "row index.\n"
    "\n"
    "A setting at the row level will only affect keys in the specific cluster "
    "and column selected along the way, i.e. only one key per row. Therefore, "
    "the row level is effectively the key level.\n"
    "\n"
    "At each level, two subsections are permitted: `parameters`, where you "
    "put the settings themselves, and a section for the next level of "
    "nesting: `clusters`, then `columns`, then `rows`. More specific settings "
    "take precedence.\n"
    "\n"
    "In the following hypothetical example, the parameter `P`, which is "
    "not really supported, is defined three times: Once at the global level "
    "and twice at the row (key) level.\n"
    "\n"
    "```by-key:\n"
    "  parameters:\n"
    "    P: true\n"
    "  clusters:\n"
    "    C:\n"
    "      columns:\n"
    "        \"1\":\n"
    "          rows:\n"
    "            first:\n"
    "              parameters:\n"
    "                P: false\n"
    "            \"3\":\n"
    "              parameters:\n"
    "                P: false\n```"
    "\n\n"
    "In this example, `P` will have the value “true” for all keys except two "
    "on each half of the keyboard. On the right-hand side, `P` will be false "
    "for the key closest to the user (“first” row) in the second column "
    "from the left (column “1”) in a cluster of keys here named `C`. `P` will "
    "also be false for the fourth key from the user (row “3”) in the same "
    "column.\n"
    "\n"
    "Columns and rows are indexed by their ordinal integers "
    "or the words “first” or “last”, which take priority.\n"
    "\n"
    "WARNING: Due to a peculiarity of the YAML parser, take care "
    "to quote your numeric column and row indices as strings. This is why "
    "there are quotation marks around column index 1 and row index 3 in the "
    "example."]
