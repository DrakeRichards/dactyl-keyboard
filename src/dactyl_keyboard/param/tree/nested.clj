  "A flat version of a special part of a user configuration."
  [["# Nestable configuration options\n\n"
    "This document describes all those settings which can be made at any "
    "level of specificity, from the entire keyboard down to one side of one "
    "key. These settings all go under `by-key` in a YAML file, as indicated "
    "[here](options-main.md).\n"
    "\n"
    "## Conceptual overview\n"
    "\n"
    "The `by-key` section contains a map of up to five items:\n"
    "\n"
    "- `parameters`, where you put actual settings for the entire keyboard. "
    "Sections described in this document all pertain to this map.\n"
    "- `clusters`, starting a nested map for specific clusters only, "
    "keyed by their names.\n"
    "- `columns` and/or `rows`, each starting a nested map for specific "
    "columns or rows only, keyed either by their indices (ordinal integers) "
    "or by the special words `first` or `last`. Due to a peculiarity of the "
    "YAML parser, **numeric indices must appear in quotation marks** as in the "
    "example below.\n"
    "- `sides`, starting a nested map for specific sides only, "
    "keyed by the long-form cardinal points of the compass, i.e. the words "
    "`north`, `east`, `south` or `west`.\n"
    "\n"
    "Each of the nested maps have the same structure as this root-level map. "
    "Greater specificity is accomplished by nesting a series of these maps.\n"
    "\n"
    "### Example\n"
    "\n"
    "In the following example, the parameter `key-style` is set three times: "
    "Once at the root level and twice with enough selection criteria to limit "
    "the effect to two individual keys.\n"
    "\n"
    "```by-key:\n"
    "  parameters:\n"
    "    key-style: plump\n"
    "  clusters:\n"
    "    C:\n"
    "      columns:\n"
    "        \"1\":\n"
    "          rows:\n"
    "            first:\n"
    "              parameters:\n"
    "                key-style: svelte\n"
    "            \"3\":\n"
    "              parameters:\n"
    "                key-style: svelte\n```"
    "\n\n"
    "In this example, `key-style` will have the value `plump` for all keys "
    "except two. It will have the value `svelte` for the key closest to the "
    "user (first row) and the key three steps above the home row (row 3), both "
    "in the second column from the left (column 1) of key cluster `C`.\n"
    "\n"
    "Key cluster `C` and the two key styles must be defined elsewhere. Also, "
    "if the keyboard uses reflection, notice that the descriptions given in "
    "the previous paragraph must be mirrored for the left-hand side of the "
    "keyboard.\n"
    "\n"
    "### Unique selection criteria\n"
    "\n"
    "The nested maps named `clusters`, `columns`, `rows` and `sides`, "
    "together with the identifiers they take as keys, are selection criteria. "
    "The order in which these criteria "
    "appear is significant, but only under the following circumstances.\n"
    "\n"
    "- The special words `first` and `last` can only be used when nested "
    "inside a cluster-specific configuration, because they are informed by "
    "the cluster matrix specification.\n"
    "- As a further requirement for rows only, `first` and `last` can only "
    "be used when nested inside a column-specific configuration, as in the "
    "example above.\n"
    "\n"
    "Each set of criteria must be unique. That is to say, each set of "
    "`parameters` must describe some new part of the keyboard. "
    "For instance, you can have either `by-key` → `rows` → `"0"` → `columns`"
    "→ `"0"` → `parameters` *or* `by-key` → `columns` → `"0"` → `rows` → `"0"`"
    "→ `parameters`, but you cannot have both. They are equivalent because "
    "they amount to identical selection criteria.\n"
    "\n"
    "This restriction applies even to the use of `first` and `last` with "
    "numeric indices. If column 8 is the last column, you can refer to it "
    "either way, but there cannot be two exactly equivalent sets of criteria, "
    "even if one uses `"8"` and the other uses the special keyword `last` to "
    "select column 8.\n"
    "\n"
    "### Specificity\n"
    "\n"
    "The application picks the most specific value available. "
    "Specificity is determined by permutations of selection criteria. "
    "More specifically, each criterion is switched on and off, starting "
    "with the least significant. Rows are considered less "
    "significant than columns for this purpose. The complete hiearchy is "
    "clusters > colums > rows > sides.\n"
    "\n"
    "An example: To find the right `key-style` "
    "for a key at coordinates `[0, -1]` in a cluster named `C`, "
    "the application checks for `parameters` → `key-style` with the "
    "following criteria, using the first setting it finds.\n"
    "\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, column 0, row -1.\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, column 0, without any specific row selector.\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, row -1, without any specific column.\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, without any specific column or row.\n"
    "- No specific cluster, column 0, row -1.\n"
    "- No specific cluster, column 0, no specific row.\n"
    "- No specific cluster or column, row -1.\n"
    "- No specific cluster, column or row.\n"
    "\n"
    "The first item in this example requires a setting specific to the "
    "individual key under consideration. "
    "The last item is at the opposite end of the spectrum of specificity: "
    "It reaches the root level, specifically looking at the "
    "setting `by-key` → `parameters` → `key-style`. This root level serves "
    "as a global fallback. It’s the only level with any default values.\n"
    "\n"
    "Notice that `sides` are ignored in the example above, because "
    "setting a `key-style` for just one side of a key, though it is permitted, "
    "is overly specific and therefore meaningless. You can compare it to "
    "a decision to paint one atom.\n"
    "\n"
    "Here follows the complete order of resolution in an extended example, "
    "for a `wall` of the same key as above. Where walls are concerned, the "
    "side of the key *would* be relevant, so its gets included in the "
    "permutations, from most to least specific.\n"
    "\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, column 0, row -1, west side.\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, column 0, row -1, no side.\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, column 0, no row, west side.\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, column 0, no row, no side.\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, no column, row -1, west side.\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, no column, row -1, no side.\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, no column, no row, west side.\n"
    "- Cluster `C`, no column, no row, no side.\n"
    "- No cluster, column 0, row -1, west side.\n"
    "- No cluster, column 0, row -1, no side.\n"
    "- No cluster, column 0, no row, west side.\n"
    "- No cluster, column 0, no row, no side.\n"
    "- No cluster, no column, row -1, west side.\n"
    "- No cluster, no column, row -1, no side.\n"
