    "\n"
    "The bottom plate is largely two-dimensional. The application builds most "

    "\n"
    "Specifically, there is one polygon per key cluster, limited to `full` "
    "wall edges, one polygon for the rear housing, and one set of polygons "
    "for each of the first-level case `tweaks` that use `at-ground`, ignoring "
    "chunk size and almost ignoring tweaks nested within lists of tweaks.\n"
    "\n"
    "This methodology is mentioned here because its results are not perfect. "
    "Pending future features in OpenSCAD, a future version may be based on a "
    "more exact projection of the case, but as of 2018, such a projection is "
    "hollow and cannot be convex-hulled without escaping the case, unless "
    "your case is convex to start with.\n"
    "\n"
    "For this reason, while the polygons fill the interior, the perimeter of "
    "the bottom plate is extended by key walls and case `tweaks` as they "
    "would appear at the height of the bottom plate. Even this brutality may "
    "be inadequate. If you require a more exact match, do a projection of the "
    "case without a bottom plate, save it as DXF/SVG etc. and post-process "
    "that file to fill the interior gap.\n"]

    "Each leaf node identifies a particular named feature of the keyboard. "
    "It’s usually a set of corner posts on a named (aliased) key mount. "
    "These are identical to the posts used to build the walls, "

    "The elements of a leaf are, in order:\n"
    "\n"
    "1. Mandatory: The name of a feature, such as a key alias.\n"
    "2. Optional: A corner ID, such as `NNE` for north by north-east. "
    "If this is omitted, i.e. if only the mandatory element is given, the "
    "tweak will use the middle of the named feature.\n"
    "3. Optional: A starting wall segment ID, which is an integer from 0 to "
    "4 inclusive. If this is omitted, but a corner is named, the default "
    "value is 0.\n"
    "4. Optional: A second wall segment ID. If this is provided, the leaf "

    "recognized:\n"
    "\n"
    "- `at-ground`: If `true`, child nodes will be extended vertically down "
    "to the ground plane, as with a `full` wall. The default value for this "
    "key is `false`. See also: `bottom-plate`.\n"
    "- `above-ground`: If `true`, child nodes will be visible as part of the "
    "case. The default value for this key is `true`.\n"
    "- `chunk-size`: Any integer greater than 1. If this is set, child nodes "
    "will not share a single convex hull. Instead, there will be a "
    "sequence of smaller hulls, each encompassing this many items.\n"
    "- `highlight`: If `true`, render the node in OpenSCAD’s "
    "highlighting style. This is convenient while you work.\n"
    "- `hull-around`: The list of child nodes. Required.\n"
    "\n"
    "In the following example, `A` and `B` are key aliases that would be "

    "The example is interpreted to mean that a plate should be "
    "created stretching from the south-by-southeast corner of `A` to the "
    "north-by-northeast corner of `B`. Due to `chunk-size` 2, that first "
    "plate will be joined, not hulled, with a second plate from `B` back to a "
    "different corner of `A`, with a longer stretch of (all) wall "
    "segments down the corner of `A`.\n"
