    In local nomenclature, the “tweaks” parameter is a grove of trees. Each

    some extra properties. Subordinate nodes cannot have these extra properties.

    The grove is parsed using a pair of dispatchers, each with its own branch
    and leaf parsers. The initial dispatcher replaces itself with a secondary
    dispatcher each time it passes a branch node, and the secondary
    dispatcher sustains itself by the trick of its parser being a function that
    refers to itself and thereby passes itself along by recreating the
    lower-lever dispatcher on each pass.

    A candidate to the dispatcher can be a lazy sequence describing a single
    point (a leaf), a lazy sequence of such sequences, or a map. If it is a
    map, it may contain a similar nested structure, or a predigested leaf.

    The basic leaf parser is permissive, having multiple arities where any
    positional argument can be replaced by a map. However, if a short-form
    (sequence) leaf starts with a map, the dispatcher will not identify it as a
    leaf, because of ambiguity with respect to a node list. A more stateful
    parser could handle that case."
