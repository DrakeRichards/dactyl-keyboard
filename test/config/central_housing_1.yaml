# Complete configuration for testing the correct placement of central-housing
# adapter fasteners on both sides of each of the eight corners of an irregular
# octagon.
#
# This is intended to be passed to the application as its only configuration
# file, as a manual regression test of the code.
#
# All sixteen receivers for fasteners should form a regular pattern on the
# adapter in the main case file output(s).
