Add that to `butty.yaml`, save it and run the application once more.

⤤ The change adds two internally threaded posts for M3 screws inside the case,
with countersinks for the same screws’ heads in the bottom plate.

Inside the case, there are notches cut into the two posts. These notches are
made by the invisible model of the MCU’s circuit board. They show that the
posts are properly aligned, with the same kind of anchoring we’ve used
elsewhere, to support the MCU without preventing assembly.

## Summary

In this part of the tutorial we have learned:

* How to include a bottom plate for the main body.
* How to tweak the bottom plate without touching the main body.
* How to add fasteners for assembly.

Our illustrated tour of some DMOTE application features is complete.
Feel free to modify the configuration further as you explore the
[options](options-main.md), or print a copy of Butty as is, for a truly
hardcore 1% experience.
